    "Although the neutral sentiment label still holds a large majority in the senitment distribution, there are enough negative and positive sentiment labels to aid in the analysis. The even distribution between negative and positive labels is interesting. Since the Tweets were scraped from the day when the FBI released its investigation of sexual assault allegations, and since news has indicated that the FBI did not find any incriminating evidence, it makes sense that there would be an even split on either side's sentiment. It may be too early to determine this, however. "
